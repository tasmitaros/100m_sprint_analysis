# 100m_sprint_analysis

## About The Project

After the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris earlier this year, I had the idea of exploring the evolution of the men’s 100m sprint — how times are dropping, how athletes are peaking at different ages, and what other trends are emerging. So, I decided to dive into the data from World Athletics and see for myself.

This Github repo contains:
- The raw csv data files
- The notebook to scrape the data from [worldathletics.org](https://worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/sprints/100-metres/outdoor/men/senior?regionType=world&timing=electronic&windReading=regular&page=1&bestResultsOnly=false&firstDay=1900-01-01&lastDay=2024-11-27)
- The notebook to explore the data, primarily using polars + seaborn + matplotlib
